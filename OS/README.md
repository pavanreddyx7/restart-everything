# LEVEL 1: BEGINNER (OS BASICS)

## Overview
This document covers the fundamental concepts of Operating Systems, marking the completion of Level 1.

- [x] **Definition of Operating System**
  - An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware.

- [x] **Objectives of Operating System**
  - **Convenience**: Makes the computer system easier to use for the user.
  - **Efficiency**: Allows computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
  - **Ability to Evolve**: Constructed in a way that permits the effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.

- [x] **Functions of Operating System**
  - **Process Management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes.
  - **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory space.
  - **File Management**: Managing files, directories, and storage.
  - **Device Management**: Managing device communication via drivers.
  - **Security**: Protecting data and resources from unauthorized access.

- [x] **Evolution of Operating Systems**
  - **Serial Processing**: No OS, direct hardware access.
  - **Simple Batch Systems**: Jobs processed in batches.
  - **Multiprogrammed Batch Systems**: Multiple jobs in memory to maximize CPU utilization.
  - **Time-Sharing Systems**: Multiprogramming with logical extension for interactive use.

- [x] **Types of Operating Systems**
  - There are several distinct types of operating systems designed for different needs.

- [x] **Batch Operating System**
  - Users do not interact with the computer directly. Users prepare jobs on an offline device (like punch cards) and submit them to the computer operator. Similar jobs are grouped together into batches.

- [x] **Multiprogramming Operating System**
  - Keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously. The OS picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in memory. If that job needs to wait for I/O, the CPU switches to another job.

- [x] **Time-Sharing Operating System**
  - A logical extension of multiprogramming. The CPU switches jobs so frequently that users can interact with each job while it is running, creating the illusion that each user has the system to themselves.

- [x] **Distributed Operating System**
  - Manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer. Computation is distributed among several physical processors.

- [x] **Network Operating System**
  - Runs on a server and provides the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions.

- [x] **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**
  - An OS intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. Strict time constraints (Hard RTOS) or less strict (Soft RTOS).

- [x] **OS as Resource Manager**
  - The OS acts as a manager of resources (CPU time, memory space, file storage space, I/O devices). It decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use.

- [x] **OS Services**
  - **User Interface**: CLI, GUI, Batch.
  - **Program Execution**: Load and run programs.
  - **I/O Operations**: Access capability to I/O devices.
  - **File System Manipulation**: Read, write, create, delete files.
  - **Communications**: Within the same computer or over a network.
  - **Error Detection**: CPU, memory, I/O device errors.
